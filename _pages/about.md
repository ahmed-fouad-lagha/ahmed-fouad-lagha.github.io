Hello! I'm **Ahmed Fouad Lagha**, a passionate AI Engineer and Data Scientist with a strong academic foundation and a deep curiosity for solving real-world problems using intelligent systems. I hold a Master’s degree in Artificial Intelligence from the University of Khenchela (Algeria) and I’m currently pursuing a **PhD in Informatics at [Eötvös Loránd University (ELTE)](https://www.elte.hu/en/), Hungary**.

My work focuses on **machine learning**, **deep learning**, and their applications in domains such as **medical image analysis**, **data mining**, and **distributed intelligent systems**. I’ve built and contributed to various projects using technologies like **Python**, **TensorFlow**, **PyTorch**, **Java**, **Django**, and **React**.

Beyond my academic and professional pursuits, I’m deeply committed to **open-source collaboration**, **lifelong learning**, and **mentoring**. I’m also enthusiastic about applying AI ethically and effectively to create meaningful impact.

When I’m not coding or conducting research, I enjoy spending time in nature, playing chess, and exploring new cultures.

Feel free to reach out — I’m always open to collaboration, research discussions, or just connecting with like-minded individuals!
